        Simple, deep-fried banana dessert. I'm unsure of cooking time because I've never timed myself. 
        I use frozen lumpia wrappers I find at my local Asian store. P.S. This is great with ice cream.
        With 30 min total time make, 10 min prep and 20 min cook time.

<h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup brown sugar, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 large bananas, halved crosswise and then lengthwise</li>
        <li>24 lumpia wrappers, defrosted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place brown sugar in a shallow bowl. Roll each banana quarter in the brown sugar until coated. 
            Wrap a lumpia wrapper around each coated banana, sealing the last edge to the roll using a spoon or your finger dipped in water. 
            Repeat with the remaining bananas and wrappers.</li>
        <li>Working in batches, fry lumpia in the hot oil until golden brown, about 5 minutes. 
            Transfer cooked lumpia to a paper towel-lined plate using a slotted spoon. 
            Some sugar may leak out the sides of the lumpia while cooling.</li>
    </ol>
